# Car Price Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict car prices based on attributes such as **Make, Model, Year, Engine Size, Mileage, Fuel Type, and Transmission**.  
It follows the assignment structure provided by the instructor, covering dataset understanding, preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, error analysis, and deployment concept.

Three models are trained and compared:
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
